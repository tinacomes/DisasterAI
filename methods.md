# Methods

Every modelling choice in the pipeline, with the literature source of every
parameter. Sections marked **TODO(cite)** must be completed from the named
papers before the corresponding computation is run — the code enforces this
(`depacc.config.require_params` refuses null placeholders and repeats the
citation in its error message). **Never** fill a parameter with an invented
or "reasonable-looking" value.

## 1. Design

Cross-sectional, multi-city study modelled on Musso et al. (PNAS, 2026,
"Large cities lose their growth advantage as countries urbanize"): one
harmonised city definition across countries (Eurostat-OECD Functional Urban
Areas, cross-checked against JRC GHS-UCDB urban centres), and *trajectories
read from the cross-sectional city-size gradient* (space-for-time
substitution). **There is deliberately no longitudinal/temporal component**;
all statements about "trajectories" are cross-sectional inferences and are
labelled as such in every output.

## 2. Potential deprivation

For each populated 100 m grid cell *i* and service type *s*, potential
deprivation is an estimated deprivation function evaluated at an *effective*
travel time. The deprivation function is the impedance function of a gravity
model run in the opposite direction: increasing and convex in travel time,
rather than a decreasing discount. Two regimes, computed as separate
surfaces per city:

### 2.1 Everyday regime (chosen, repeated, substitutable)

1. **2SFCA congestion factor.** Step 1 computes the supply-to-demand ratio
   per facility *j*: `R_j = S_j / Σ_i P_i K(t_ij)` with kernel *K*
   (gaussian, mode-specific bandwidth; config `catchment.kernel`). The
   decreasing kernel appears *only* inside this competition weighting.
   Step 2 converts crowding into a travel-time inflation
   `c_j = (R_ref / R_j)^γ` (reference: demand-weighted median ratio in the
   city; exponent γ and clip bounds in config; γ = 0 disables congestion).
2. **Soft-minimum reducer.** Effective deprivation time
   `t_eff(i) = -(1/κ) ln Σ_j exp(-κ · t_ij · c_j)`, a smooth minimum with
   the deliberate property that several similar-time options reduce the
   effective time (substitutability bonus); bounds
   `min - ln(n)/κ ≤ t_eff ≤ min` (unit-tested). κ in config
   (`softmin.kappa`), sensitivity-swept.
3. **Deprivation.** `D_ev(i) = g_DLF(t_eff(i))`.

### 2.2 Emergency regime (non-substitutable, time-critical)

`D_em(i) = g_DCF(min_j t_ij)` — nearest facility only; the convexity of the
DCF is where its shape matters most.

### 2.3 Baseline

For **both** regimes, the plain nearest-facility travel time is always
computed and reported as a comparison baseline.

### 2.4 Unreachable cells

Cells with no reachable facility of a service within `routing.max_time_min`
are flagged explicitly and handled by config policy — `cap_at_max_time`
(default: deprivation at the cutoff time) or `exclude` (NaN, dropped from
aggregates) — and their population share is always reported.

## 3. Deprivation functions (form transferred, curvature calibrated)

The two regimes use deliberately different shapes (t in **minutes**):

| Regime | Kind | Form | Parameters | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Everyday | DLF (dimensionless) | **logistic** (saturating) `g(t) = Lmax / (1 + e^{−k(t − t0)})` | Lmax = 1.0, t0 = 15 min, k = 0.2 /min | Wang et al. 2017 — logistic S-curve of needs-based severity |
| Emergency | DCF (monetary) | **Box-Cox** (convex, escalating) `g(t) = scale·((t+shift)^λ − shift^λ)/λ` | λ = 1.8, shift = 1 min, scale = 1.0 (relative) | Cantillo et al. 2018; Delgado-Lindeman 2019 — ambulance / time-to-care DCF |

**Everyday deprivation SATURATES** — everyday services are substitutable and
non-critical, so relative deprivation tops out at the ceiling Lmax once
access is poor enough; the inflection t0 = 15 min encodes the "15-minute
city" access threshold (g(15) = 0.5), and the surface is ~saturated by
~45 min. This is a deliberate departure from a globally convex impedance:
the logistic is convex below t0 and concave above, and g(0) is a small
positive baseline (= Lmax/(1+e^{k·t0}) ≈ 0.05) rather than exactly 0.

**Emergency deprivation ESCALATES** without bound — it is time-critical, so
the convex Box-Cox (λ > 1) rises ever more steeply; the curvature is tuned so
the cost climbs sharply through the clinical time-to-care threshold
(g(60)/g(45) ≈ 1.66, i.e. +66% over that 15-minute window). g(0) = 0.

**Provenance — form transferred, curvature calibrated (NOT raw coefficient
transfer).** The published DLF/DCF estimates are on an *hours*-scale
deprivation-time basis (hours without water/food/care), not the *minutes*
scale of intra-urban access, so their coefficients are not directly
transferable. We therefore transfer the *functional form* from the cited
work and *calibrate the curvature* to domain anchors: the everyday S-curve to
the intra-urban 15-minute access threshold, and the emergency convexity to
the ~45–60 min clinical time-to-care threshold. This is recorded honestly
here and in each spec's `note:` field in `config/deprivation.yaml`; the
curvature parameters (k, λ) are the primary sensitivity-analysis targets.

The emergency `scale` is left at 1.0 (relative units); anchor it to a value
of statistical life / value of time only if absolute monetary magnitudes are
needed — relative results (Ginis, typology, rankings) are scale-invariant.
Alternative specifications for sensitivity analysis live in
`config/deprivation.yaml → deprivation.alternatives`.

## 4. Divergence outputs (the central result)

1. **Cell-level co-location:** bivariate typology at population-weighted
   median thresholds (quantile configurable): LL/LH/HL/**HH** (compounding
   deprivation), population-weighted and mapped.
2. **City-level divergence:** each city as a point in the
   (Gini of everyday deprivation, Gini of emergency deprivation) plane;
   off-diagonal spread measured alongside population-weighted mean levels.
3. **Trajectory:** cities ordered along the FUA-population size gradient;
   test whether everyday and emergency deprivation/inequity co-evolve or
   diverge with size. Cross-sectional (space-for-time) inference only.

## 5. Travel times

Two engines, selected per city config (`routing.engine`):

- **r5 (reference, Tier 2):** R5 via r5py (JDK 21) for walk + car + transit
  on OSM (.pbf) and GTFS; street-level resolution; departure window in
  `routing.departure`.
- **friction (Tier-1 fast path):** least-cost paths (Dijkstra on the
  8-connected pixel graph, latitude-corrected metric distances) over the
  Weiss et al. (2020) 30-arc-second friction surfaces — motorised for car,
  walking-only for walk — fetched as per-city WCS windows. Facilities come
  from Overpass API queries (polygon features reduced to centre points; no
  min-area filter — immaterial at ~1 km resolution). This scales the
  continental sample without per-city bulk downloads; it is coarser, so
  Tier-2 r5 runs cross-check whether ENGINE choice changes city rankings
  (§7), exactly as the transit-vs-no-transit check does.

Origins: centroids of populated GHS-POP 100 m cells within the FUA;
destinations: OSM facilities per service (`config/services.yaml`, capacity
sources flagged where proxied).

## 6. Equity statistics

Population-weighted mean deprivation; population-weighted Gini (covariance
form); concentration index against SES rank (Tier 2: income/rent proxies
from national 100–200 m grids); within-city gradient regressions
(deprivation on income/rent proxy, age structure, household composition).

## 7. Data quality

OSM facility completeness characterised **per country** by benchmarking OSM
hospital/pharmacy counts against national registries (or OSM intrinsic
quality metrics); completeness table produced by `quality/`; the Tier-1
sample can be restricted to cities above `quality.completeness_threshold`.
For Tier 2 we test whether adding transit changes city *rankings* and
clustering, not just levels.

## 8. Reproducibility

Config-driven (YAML per city + tier); cached downloads with SHA-256
provenance sidecars; no raw data committed; unit tests on the DLF/DCF
mapping, soft-min reducer, 2SFCA factor, unreachable handling and the
divergence typology; CI runs the tests on every push.
